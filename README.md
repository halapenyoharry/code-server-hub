# Code Server Hub üéõÔ∏è

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **ALPHA RELEASE** - This is experimental software. Expect bugs, breaking changes, and incomplete features. Use at your own risk in development environments only.

A real-time web dashboard for discovering and managing all your local development services, with special powers for code-server instances and web terminals (ttyd/GoTTY).

## What It Does & Why It's Helpful

**The Problem**: You're running multiple development services (VS Code servers, databases, web apps, terminals) but have no easy way to see what's running, start/stop them, or access them from your phone/tablet.

**The Solution**: Code Server Hub gives you:

### üîç **Universal Service Discovery**
- **Automatically finds** all running services on common development ports
- **Identifies service types**: code-server, databases, web servers, terminals, AI services
- **Real-time monitoring** - see services start/stop as they happen
- **Works everywhere** - access from any device on your network

### üéÆ **Powerful Management**
- **Manage your code-server instances** - start, stop, restart individual or all instances
- **Web terminal support** - integrated ttyd/GoTTY terminal management
- **One-click access** - open any service directly from the dashboard
- **System monitoring** - CPU, memory, network usage

### üì± **Mobile-Friendly**
- **Beautiful web UI** that works perfectly on iPad, iPhone, Android
- **PWA support** - install as an app on your devices
- **Real-time updates** - all connected devices stay in sync
- **HTTPS ready** - secure access with proper certificates

### ‚ö° **Zero Configuration Discovery**
Unlike other tools that require manual service registration, Code Server Hub **automatically discovers** what you're already running. Just start it and go!

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 16+ and npm
- **code-server** (for VS Code instances): `brew install code-server`
- **ttyd** (for web terminals): `brew install ttyd`
- **macOS** (currently optimized for macOS, Linux support coming)

### Quick Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/halapenyoharry/code-server-hub.git
cd code-server-hub

# Run setup script
./setup.sh

# Start the hub
./start.sh
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Copy instances template and customize
cp instances.json.example instances.json

# Configure your local paths
cp config/paths.json.example config/paths.json
nano config/paths.json  # Edit to match your directory structure

# Edit instances.json to configure your workspaces
nano instances.json

# Generate SSL certificates (for HTTPS)
mkdir -p ~/code-server-data/shared/certs
cd ~/code-server-data/shared/certs
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout code-server.key -out code-server.pem \
  -subj "/CN=localhost"

# Start the hub
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:7777

## Features

üîç **Auto-Discovery**
- Scans common development ports automatically
- Identifies service types (code-server, databases, web servers, etc.)
- Updates in real-time via WebSocket

üìä **Visual Dashboard**
- Beautiful web UI accessible from any device
- System resource monitoring (CPU, Memory, Network)
- Service categorization with icons

üéÆ **Service Control**
- Start/stop services from the UI
- Open code-server instances with one click
- View detailed service information

üåê **Network Ready**
- Access from iPad, phone, or any device
- Real-time updates across all connected clients
- Self-signed HTTPS for secure access

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
PORT=7777                          # Hub port
NODE_ENV=production               # Environment
CODE_SERVER_DATA_DIR=~/code-server-data  # Data directory
CODE_SERVER_BIN=code-server       # Path to code-server
```

### Instance Configuration

Edit `instances.json` to define your code-server instances:

```json
{
  "instances": {
    "5253": {
      "type": "code-server",
      "port": 5253,
      "name": "Main Projects",
      "description": "Primary workspace",
      "icon": "üìÅ",
      "color": "#0099ff",
      "workspace": "${PROJECTS_DIR}"  // Uses path from config/paths.json
    },
    "9923": {
      "type": "gotty",
      "port": 9923,
      "name": "Terminal",
      "description": "Web terminal",
      "icon": "üñ•Ô∏è",
      "color": "#8b5cf6",
      "command": "bash"
    }
  }
}
```

### Path Configuration

The hub supports path placeholders to keep your configuration portable across devices:

1. **Configure your paths** in `config/paths.json`:
```json
{
  "PROJECTS_DIR": "/Users/yourusername/Projects",
  "CODE_SERVER_DATA": "/Users/yourusername/code-server-data",
  "SERVERS_DIR": "/Users/yourusername/servers"
}
```

2. **Use placeholders** in `instances.json`:
- `${PROJECTS_DIR}` - Your main projects directory
- `${SERVERS_DIR}` - Your servers directory
- `${CODE_SERVER_DATA}` - Code-server data directory
- `${HOME}` - Your home directory (environment variable)

This allows the same `instances.json` to work across different machines with different directory structures.

## Architecture

This is the foundation for the larger vision:
- Currently: Discovers and manages code-server instances
- Future: Universal service discovery and management
- Eventually: AI-powered service interpretation and automation

## How It Works

1. **Service Discovery**: Scans common ports every 5 seconds
2. **Process Identification**: Uses `lsof` to identify what's running
3. **Type Detection**: Pattern matching to categorize services
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket broadcasts changes to all clients
5. **Visual Interface**: Modern web UI with real-time updates

## Extending

The modular design makes it easy to add:
- New service types in `SERVICE_PATTERNS`
- Additional ports in `COMMON_PORTS`
- Custom actions for different service types
- AI integration for service interpretation

## Future Vision

This is step 1 of making the invisible visible:
- Add MCP server discovery
- Integrate AI for explaining unknown services
- Add service relationship mapping
- Create visual dependency graphs
- Enable cross-service orchestration

## Known Issues

- **SSL Certificate Trust**: VS Code extensions may fail with SSL errors until certificates are manually trusted. See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for details and workaround.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.io
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS with real-time updates
- **Discovery**: System calls (lsof, ps, curl)
- **Monitoring**: systeminformation package

## Contributing

This is the beginning of democratizing service management. Ideas welcome!
